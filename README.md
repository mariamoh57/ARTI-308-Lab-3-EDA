### Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for **Lab 3** in the **Machine Learning (ARTI 308)** course at IAU. The project focuses on exploring a survey dataset regarding mental health in the tech industry to identify patterns and clean data for future modeling.

### Dataset Information
The dataset used is the **Mental Health in Tech Survey** from Kaggle. It includes various features like age, gender, company size, and benefits.

### EDA Process
I followed a structured data science workflow:
* **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
* **Outlier Removal**: Cleaned the 'Age' column from unrealistic values.
* **Visualization**: Developed clear charts to represent the data.

### Key Insights
* **Insight 1:** Larger companies (1000+) tend to provide more mental health benefits.
* **Insight 2:** Gender plays a significant role in treatment-seeking patterns.
* **Insight 3:** Data quality was improved by handling unrealistic age entries.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` installed.
3. Open `ARTI308_Lab3_EDA.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
